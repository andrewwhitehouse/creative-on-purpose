## what is the lifestyle you want your next endeavor to help fund and fit around? 

I want it to generate enough income that it can cover our outgoings, currently around £10,000-£12,000 a month. 

The main thing is a large mortgage. And four children.

I want to be able to work abroad, where it's warm. And visit other places while I'm working.

## Of all things you could develop as a project, which is the one that is calling you most adamantly? 

Hmm difficult.

I think about a better way to process podcasts because I'm curious about lots of things.

I think about how I could help people who are early in their careers, looking for the fulfilment of using software to build useful things in the context of AI and remote working, and to feel supported in their work, partiularly those who find it more difficult because they have some degree of neurodiversity.

I want to help people build products so that they don't have to be told by other people what they can spend their time on.

And to help people learn tech.

Even at 56 I'm still learnng and I want better ways to do that because most learning platforms don't work well for those of us who are time poor and with lots of different commitments.

## Which one really lights you up when you think about it? 

I don't know. Something that involves creaing software products as experiments and then iterating. I want it to be a large enough market that the work pulls me rather than me having to work too hard to find customers.

I would like to build a product that gets better the more people use it by being community-based. And I would like it to use Noah Kagan's metric of 100,000 users or a million in revenue per annum.

## What assets do you already possess that can be releveraged to help develop and deliver your next thing?

Experience mentoring developers in Code Your Future, and as a lead developer at work

Software development skills
Empathy
A desire to nurture technical creates who need the support, and who can see that there is another way to having a technical career without having to deal with the BS that many corporate jobs force you through

Allow people to pursue a career in building products that gives them autonomy, mastery and purpose

## Background

ADHD
challening early years
My challenge is I need to feel I must work harder

Coach or consultant or teacher; what about builder. They help people to get from where they are to where they want to be.

I'm very sensitive to the people around me; I want to see them smiling, and appreciate the skills I bring.

Goal: building time and financial freedom

And networking and buildign more connections

I try all the things and sometimes I get stuck spinning my wheels. She tries to stay focus and keep good notes.

what you want to accomplish in 90 days should be in service of the vision you want o accomplish

Is paying attention to this getting me further away from my ideal lifestyle (or closer)?

[N.B. Other things I do. Choir, BSB.]

When you clarify what your ideal lifestyle is, you are defining what success means to you. It means you're also defining what failure looks like.

Guadrian Academy, Man Bites dog.

There's MJ's client work, and MJ's life work.

MJ is building a client list from 5000 people who are in the rear view mirror.

Scott: it is up to you to manage your inputs.

"Take what you need and leave the rest"

On our onboarding call we set a vector.

You have to be willing to master the mundane.

Penny - like a stand up comedian
Brie - your curiosity is a superpower

Other coaches use the socratic method to keep askign quesions to arrive at the decision you want to arive at. Scott coaches for agreement.

Between what you say and your client is interpretation. Practise more active listening.

"Here's what I heard, is that right?"

Systems are a function of the efficiency of their components; the least efficient the components, the least efficient the system.

Recapture and recalibrate

Where is all your money being spent. Also where my current time is being spent. Reputation.

Any resource you allways think of. Time is what we consider. Identity. Reputation. Energy and effort.

Here's where I'm spending all my time attention and effort. Now that I know what I want.

Should I re-apply it to my priority.

How is subscribing to these servics helping you.

Think a little bit more ... you should be doing something that aligns with your personality, preferences, skills, talents.

It's always about the next micro-step.

There are kinks in the hose.

What is the next most immediate kinks we need to sort out.

More money freedowm, more time freedom, more time to do what I want to do.

What do I want my average week to look like?

My belief is that I want to get everything done that I want to get done in a couple of hours a day.

N.B. The rearview mirror exercise.

And then it's about "what's the step before the step".

Can I have conversations (Penny).

Let's re-validate the product. Productise coaching. Build once sell forever.

I want to help people who are time-pressed or attention-pressed.

He was bored, he didn't have ADHD.

Measure: does it energise me?

What we suck at is doing things in the way we should do them.

1. Getting more specific about the project.
2. Rear view mirror
3. Full audit of assets and abilities and resources.

Think about: I have an instinct an intuition ... I could do this thing ... it excites me so that I want to try it. Who are the people I know and trust ... and you would be excited to work with that people ... can I get more specific around the initial problem ... 

ADHD: impulse control ... too many directions ... how do I wake up in teh morning and empty my inbox ... if I get on social media I immediately start doom scrolling ... burnout coaches can't solve your overwhelme and burnout problems ... if you can identity a specific problem ... look at a smaller version of that project, can you solve a smaller version ... the reason why you're not getting what you what ... you don't really know what you want ... 

1. clear enough definition of what you want
2. clear enough definiiton of what you're starying wih
3. two or three things that get you from where you want to be

There are certainly ways that people you're connecting with in other areas would be intreested in becoming involved. Be judicious in what you cut out.

Principles:
- receptivity (be open to the fact that anything can help you do anything else ... are you willing to trade off the time energy and effort)
- restrains ... the restraint to not make decisions based on cognitive bias and things that are not tru
- responsibility ... I get to decide what I do next

You can micro-step your way to deciding on any of these other activities.

Anything that you do, do with a reserve clause ... you are making decisions basd on who you are now ... leave some wiggle room. Leave space for serendipity.
