> One of the most important lessons I learned as a musician, teacher, writer, and coach is that success in building a fulfilling and flourishing business that funds and fits your ideal lifestyle depends entirely on your commitment to becoming a better person.

Receptivity 

> Acknowledge that we all believe most of what we believe simply because we believe it.

> Step away from the delusion and comfort of your flawed convictions, limiting false beliefs, cognitive biases, and personal prejudices.

> Hold your assertions loosely and stress test their accuracy.

> Think less dogmatically and more scientifically.

> Embrace the infinite game of a growth mindset and step into possibility.

Restraint

> Just because you can doesn’t mean you should. (Or shouldn't)

> Embrace sufficiency and practice enoughness. Less is more.

> Perfectionism is a trap. It’s a seductive hiding place. Avoid perfectionism.

> Cultivate readiness—being prepared enough to take the next best step and do the next right thing.

> Step into the arena when you’re ready.

> Engage the field with intention and integrity

> You can’t win a game you don’t want to play. Play your game.

> Avoid greediness and excess. The enemy of getting closer to what you want is chasing more than you need.

> Success requires only a few things to go well enough. Dial in the few necessary things and raise the floor on the least efficient or effective one.

> Cultivating receptivity and restraint are their own rewards, but responsibility is the catalyst for the dedicated difference-maker to become a more successful solopreneur.

Responsibility

> Know thyself. Who are you? What are you good at? Where do you belong?

> Recognize the distinction between what is within your control and what isn’t. External circumstances, what others say and do, and outcomes are beyond your direct influence. Focus on what you can control—how you see things and what you do.

> Embrace reality. See things as they are, not as you wish them to be. Accept reality without judgment.

> Take intentional action. Bias micro-steps. Just do the next right thing.

> Remember what matters before you step into what’s next.

> Obstacles are inevitable. Most are also opportunities, even when the opportunity is to practice the virtues of acceptance, patience, humility, and resilience.

> Your freedom to do what you want, when you want, with whom you want, where you want ends where it impedes someone else’s ability to do the same.

> The process is the shortcut.
