Coaching reflections

## what is the lifestyle you want your next endeavor to help fund and fit around? 

(keep iterating on these qustions)

I want to be able to work abroad, where it's warm. And visit other places while I'm working.

I want to feel a connecting with my colleagues and actually do something that's challenging and teach my children to have the confidence to try things for themselves.

##Â What is the difference you seek to make?

and for whom?

## Of all things you could develop as a project, which is the one that is calling you most adamantly? 

I think about a better way to process podcasts because I'm curious about lots of things.

I think about how I could help people who are early in their careers, looking for the fulfilment of using software to build useful things in the context of AI and remote working, and to feel supported in their work, partiularly those who find it more difficult because they have some degree of neurodiversity.

I want to help people build products so that they don't have to be told by other people what they can spend their time on.

And to help people learn tech.

Even at 56 I'm still learnng and I want better ways to do that because most learning platforms don't work well for those of us who are time poor and with lots of different commitments.

## Which one really lights you up when you think about it? 

I don't know. Something that involves creaing software products as experiments and then iterating. I want it to be a large enough market that the work pulls me rather than me having to work too hard to find customers.

I would like to build a product that gets better the more people use it by being community-based. And I would like it to use Noah Kagan's metric of 100,000 users or a million in revenue per annum.

## What assets do you already possess that can be releveraged to help develop and deliver your next thing?

Experience mentoring developers in Code Your Future, and as a lead developer at work

Software development skills
Empathy
A desire to nurture technical creates who need the support, and who can see that there is another way to having a technical career without having to deal with the BS that many corporate jobs force you through

Allow people to pursue a career in building products that gives them autonomy, mastery and purpose

Anything that you do, do with a reserve clause ... you are making decisions basd on who you are now ... leave some wiggle room. Leave space for serendipity.
