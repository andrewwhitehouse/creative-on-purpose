Nine fundamentals of moving from the game of life is playing you, then you can't win a game you don't want to play, starting to pick up some of the tools and habits where you reach self-actualisation.

You're stepping into your power to play a game you actually want to play.

This call is mostly about settig up the situation.

"The way out is through" ... but before you can navigate your way through you have to be able to step "into".

Awakening - waking up to the fact that the game of life is playing you.

"I played by the rules and did all of the things I was supposed to do and I'm still not happy"

Routines

Waking up to the fact that we are mostly sleep-walking through our life
95% of what you do today is like what you did yesterday
Same for what you think (today is like yesterday)

We are responding to programming and conditioning
Our amygdala can work against us

We like to know where we stand (safety) and we also seek out the new and embrace innovation; the desire to stay humber and keep our head down has been reinforced (e.g. through schooling)

Learned helplessness: reinforced by institutions and occupation; we were told that if we follow the rules everything will be OK for us. Roadmaps can only take you where everyone else has been and where they're going.

Amazon reinforces learned helplessness because you don't have to take responsibility for wrong purchase. (If you know there'll be a recording from reading the blog you won't ask the question.)

As roles end, that challenges our identity that has been tied up in the roles we do. We have to reconigse our attachment to these roles and goals. We need to figure out an identity that takes account of the many facets of who we are, and not be too clingy and attached to who we are.

At any point you can be invested in an identity which increases your fragility in situations becuase we navigate our way through roles and goals throughout our day.

Summary:
- be aware of our programming and conditioning that is the learned helplessness we've been encouraged to practise and the dangers of the identity trap

Reactivity

Drop the drama. Kartman's drama triangle. In any situation where drame is involved: victim, rescuer and persecutor.

There are situations where we feel circumstances are conspiring against us. N.B. Podcast with Penny.

Anxiety, dismay, regret etc. if there is a drama narrative at play, which role are you playing?

If you can eliminate the victim narrative, nobody else has a job.

The resuer is the most dangerous player in the traingle. We like to help people, we are generous, compassionate. The desire to solve other people's problems for them is a seductive way to not pay attention to our own. Is there something we are hiding from? Are we reinforcing their learned helplessness?

Most of the time, persecutor may not exist. Because everyone thinks they are doing what they need to do. So it's up to the victim to address their narrative.

2. Curbing your dogmatic thinking.

"I believe what I belive because I belive it"

The antidote is scientific thinking: show me the logic and if it can't be seen it's something you may not want to spend a lot of your time on.

3. The blame game

Are you living in stories about regret and blame of what's happened in the past? Are you looking out the window at all of the things that are to blame. The mirror becaomes very important here. The source of what's holding us back is usually down to the person looking in the mirror, and the solution does too.

Relationships

Be aware of the intention impact gap. Paper: "the rocky road between intentions and actions".

People had conflicts ... the intention is not to cause others pain or hardship ... but we don't always communicate as clearly and respectfully as we think we do.

Between intention and impact there lies interpretation. Everybody can see differently what's being said and done.

The Dunning Kruger effect. When we have a bit of success, we think we are smarter than we might be. When we see someone who doesn't appear to be as smart having some success it can be and we compare ourselves with them, that's an issue.

Recognise the power of networks. You are the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with. That's false. Actually you are the cumulative average of everyone in your network.

Who are you spending more time with, paying attention to and how can you be thoughtful and deliberate about building boundaries and guardrails about people you feel you should be connected to so they don't drag down your average.

Dunning Kruger: we're constantly comparing ourselves with other people.

We need to be thoughtful about where we spend our time.

Scott: if your therapy has coaching skills thats ideal. Some therapists just say "uh huh". Coaches who claim to be therapists are super dangerous. "Trauma coach" sets of a warning for Scott.

If we all just continue to repeat our sad stories we will continue to live our sad stories.

If you see someone heading out of bounds it's helpful to re-state the boundaries and guardrails and guide them back.

In group discussions be an active listening: here's what I heard, did I get it right?

"You have depressions ... depression's all made up. Reminds me of what Scott said about ADHD".

Why am I resisting using Spring in my project?

> We seem to reward the people with the highest degree of certainty and over-confidence even when they have no right to any confidence in the things that they're certian about because they're things that can't be absolutely defined or determined.

The antidote to that is consideration. What if you didn't have to understand or now? Both things could be true. There is room for multiple interpretations. Embrace not knowing, or embrace the considation that there might be room for more than one perspective ... and consering that you may not be as smart as you think you are:

DALA - directions for acting like an adult.

If your actions are not reflecting your attentions then you're not acting like an adult.

Scott uses these workshops to test the ideas he's considering in hsi book.
